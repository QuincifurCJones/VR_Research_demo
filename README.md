# VR User Research: 2nd Person Camera Control Testing
## Concept: the user's headset is the direct camera, and they must manuver it around a 3D platformer to see obstacles.

# Method 1: Stagnant Level, User Moves - 
## The user moves around a centered object (the level) to see different details and where the player is currently located in that level.

# Method 2: Stagnant Player, Moving Level - 
## The user does not directly move in this version, they can instead utilize one of the Meta Quest controller thumb-sticks to rotate the module.
### This in reality may actually still rotate the camera's position, but it will seem as if the island is rotating instead.

# Method 3: Stagnant Player, Turning Level - 
## Similar to method 2, the player is in a set playspace and cannot move, the level is now moved with a turning motion of the controller instead.
### I.E. The user would hold the trigger and swing their hand right to rotate the level counterclockwise
